---

# Installation

Greenseed is distributed as an npm package and can be installed using your preferred JavaScript package manager.

## Requirements

Before installing Greenseed, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** version 16 or higher
- **PostgreSQL** database (version 10 or higher recommended)
- A JavaScript package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun)

## Install with package managers

Choose your preferred package manager to install Greenseed:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install greenseed
```

```bash yarn
yarn add greenseed
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add greenseed
```

```bash bun
bun add greenseed
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Greenseed is typically installed as a development dependency since it's primarily used for seeding development and test databases. To install as a dev dependency, add the `-D` or `--save-dev` flag.
</Note>

## Install as dev dependency

If you only need Greenseed for development and testing:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install -D greenseed
```

```bash yarn
yarn add -D greenseed
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -D greenseed
```

```bash bun
bun add -d greenseed
```
</CodeGroup>

## Verify installation

After installation, verify that Greenseed is available by running:

```bash
npx greenseed --version
```

You can also check the available commands:

```bash
npx greenseed --help
```

Expected output:
```
greenseed

  Usage:
    $ greenseed <command> [options]

  Available Commands:
    push    Seed the database from JSON files
    init    Create a new seed configuration file

  For more info, run any command with the `--help` flag:
    $ greenseed push --help
    $ greenseed init --help
```

## Dependencies

Greenseed automatically installs the following dependencies:

- **`postgres`** - High-performance PostgreSQL client for Node.js
- **`dotenv`** - Loads environment variables from `.env` files
- **`valibot`** - Schema validation for configuration files
- **`sade`** - Lightweight CLI framework

<Tip>
No additional database drivers or configuration is needed. Greenseed works out of the box with PostgreSQL connection strings.
</Tip>

## Global installation

For system-wide access to the `greenseed` command, you can install globally:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install -g greenseed
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add greenseed
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g greenseed
```

```bash bun
bun add -g greenseed
```
</CodeGroup>

After global installation, you can use `greenseed` directly without `npx`:

```bash
greenseed push
```

<Warning>
Global installations can cause version conflicts across projects. We recommend installing Greenseed locally per project and using `npx greenseed` instead.
</Warning>

## Running without installation

You can run Greenseed directly without installing using `npx`:

```bash
npx greenseed init
npx greenseed push
```

This is useful for one-off operations or when trying Greenseed before committing to installation.

## Package scripts

For convenient access, add Greenseed commands to your `package.json` scripts:

```json package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "db:seed": "greenseed push",
    "db:seed:init": "greenseed init"
  }
}
```

Then run with your package manager:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm run db:seed
```

```bash yarn
yarn db:seed
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm db:seed
```

```bash bun
bun db:seed
```
</CodeGroup>

## Environment setup

Greenseed requires a PostgreSQL connection string in an environment variable. Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb
```

<Note>
The environment variable name is configurable in `seed.config.json`. By default, Greenseed looks for `DATABASE_URL`.
</Note>
